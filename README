NAME
    fand is an OpenBSD deamon to control fan speed depends on CPU temperature

INSTALLATION
    Currently fand works only with Lenovo/IBM Thinkpad laptops and requires
    custom kernel to be run. Kernel must be patched with hw.fanlevel.patch
    patch included into the current distribution.

    Steps to install and setup fand.
     1. Apply hw.fanlevel.patch, compile and run custom kernel.
     2. Make sure hw.fanlevel works as expected.
        # sysctl hw.fanlevel
        hw.fanlevel=128
        # sysctl hw.fanlevel=3
        hw.fanlevel: 128 -> 3
        # sysctl hw.fanlevel
        hw.fanlevel=3

        Play with 0-8 and 128 (automatic control) values to make sure everything
        works as expected. It is expected to be a few seconds delay between
        sysctl value set and actual fan speed change.
     3. Install fand port using https://github.com/vchimishuk/openbsd-ports/tree/master/sysutils/fand
        See fand(1) for more details.
     4. Potentially it can be dengerous and lead to hardware damage. However,
        modern hardware should have embeded overheat protection.
